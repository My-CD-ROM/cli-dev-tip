  title: Use enumerate() instead of range(len())
  body: >
    Instead of `for i in range(len(items))`, use `for i, item in enumerate(items)`.
    It's more Pythonic and gives you both the index and value.
  example: |
    for i, name in enumerate(names, start=1):
        print(f"{i}. {name}")

  title: f-strings support expressions and formatting
  body: >
    f-strings can contain any valid Python expression, including method calls,
    math, and format specifiers.
  example: |
    name = "world"
    print(f"{'hello':>10} {name.upper()}")
    print(f"pi = {3.14159:.2f}")

  title: Use pathlib for file paths
  body: >
    The pathlib module provides an object-oriented interface for filesystem paths.
    It's cross-platform and more readable than os.path.
  example: |
    from pathlib import Path
    config = Path.home() / ".config" / "app" / "settings.toml"
    config.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

  title: Walrus operator for assignment expressions
  body: >
    The := operator assigns and returns a value in one expression.
    Useful in while loops and comprehensions.
  example: |
    # Read lines until empty
    while (line := input("Enter text: ")) != "":
        print(f"You said: {line}")

  title: Use git stash to save work in progress
  body: >
    `git stash` saves your uncommitted changes and reverts to a clean working
    directory. Use `git stash pop` to restore them later.
  example: |
    git stash
    git checkout main
    # do some work
    git checkout feature-branch
    git stash pop

  title: Interactive rebase to clean up commits
  body: >
    Use `git rebase -i` to squash, reorder, or edit commits before pushing.
    Keeps your branch history clean and logical.
  example: |
    git rebase -i HEAD~3
    # In the editor, change 'pick' to 'squash' or 'fixup'

  title: Use git bisect to find bugs
  body: >
    `git bisect` performs a binary search through your commit history to find
    the exact commit that introduced a bug.
  example: |
    git bisect start
    git bisect bad           # current commit is broken
    git bisect good v1.0.0   # this tag was working
    # git checks out middle commit, you test, then:
    git bisect good  # or git bisect bad

  title: Amend the last commit message

  title: Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
  body: >
    Multi-stage builds let you use one stage for building and another for the
    final image. This keeps your production image small and clean.
  example: |
    FROM node:20 AS builder
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN npm ci && npm run build

    FROM node:20-slim
    COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

  title: Use .dockerignore to speed up builds
  body: >
    A .dockerignore file prevents unnecessary files from being sent to the
    Docker daemon during builds, making them faster.
  example: |
    # .dockerignore
    node_modules
    .git
    *.md
    .env

  title: Use HEALTHCHECK in your Dockerfile
  body: >
    HEALTHCHECK tells Docker how to verify your container is still working.
    Orchestrators use this to restart unhealthy containers.
  example: |
    HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
      CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

  title: Pin image versions in production
  body: >
    Always use specific image tags instead of `latest` in production.
    This ensures reproducible builds and deployments.
  example: |
    # Bad
    FROM python:latest
    # Good
    FROM python:3.12-slim@sha256:abc123...

  title: Use COALESCE to handle NULL values
  body: >
    COALESCE returns the first non-NULL value from a list of arguments.
    Great for providing default values in queries.
  example: |
    SELECT name, COALESCE(nickname, name) AS display_name
    FROM users;

  title: Use CTEs for readable complex queries
  body: >
    Common Table Expressions (WITH clauses) let you break complex queries
    into named, readable steps.
  example: |
    WITH active_users AS (
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    )
    SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM active_users
    GROUP BY department;

  title: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to debug slow queries

    EXPLAIN ANALYZE runs the query and shows the actual execution plan
    with timing information. Essential for performance tuning.
  example: |
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT * FROM orders
    WHERE customer_id = 42
    ORDER BY created_at DESC;

  title: Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries
  body: >
    EXISTS can be faster than IN for correlated subqueries because it
    stops scanning once a match is found.
  example: |
    -- Instead of: WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders)
    SELECT * FROM users u
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.user_id = u.id);

    Press ctrl+r in your terminal to search through your command history.
    Keep pressing ctrl+r to cycle through matches.

    # Press ctrl+r, then type 'docker'
    # It will find your last command containing 'docker'

  title: Use xargs to pass stdin as arguments
  body: >
    xargs reads items from stdin and executes a command with those items
    as arguments. Combine with find or grep for powerful pipelines.
  example: |
    # Delete all .pyc files
    find . -name "*.pyc" | xargs rm
    # Run tests for changed files
    git diff --name-only | grep test | xargs pytest

    The tee command reads from stdin and writes to both stdout and a file.

  title: Use watch to repeat a command
  body: >
    The watch command runs a command repeatedly and displays the output.
    Great for monitoring changing values.

    # Watch pod status every 2 seconds
    watch -n 2 kubectl get pods
    # Watch disk usage
    watch df -h
